BIRDSUITE RELEASE 1.5.3

Tue Nov 19 2008

http://wwwdev.broad.mit.edu/mpg/birdsuite/

INTRODUCTION

This Birdsuite release contains most of the files you need to build and install Birdsuite.  

LIMITATIONS

* Currently, this Birdsuite release only runs on 32- or 64-bit Linux systems, although it may be
  possible to make it work on other systems, particularly if you have Matlab for the target
  system.

* Currently, Birdsuite metadata exists only for Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 5.0 and 6.0 arrays

* Some files are not distributed by Broad Institute, and must be obtained from other parties.  

PREREQUISITES

* Java 1.5 or higher (http://www.java.com)
* Python 2.4 or higher (http://www.python.org)
* numpy Python package, version 1.0.1 or higher (http://numpy.scipy.org)
* R 2.4 or higher (http://www.r-project.org)
* mclust R package, version 3 or higher (http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/web/packages/mclust/index.html)
* Affymetrix Power Tools (APT) 1.8.6 or higher, binaries (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/developer/powertools/index.affx)
* Affymetrix library bundle for Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 (http://www.affymetrix.com/Auth/support/downloads/library_files/genomewidesnp6_libraryfile.zip)

PREREQUISITES FOR BUILDING EXECUTABLES FROM SOURCES

For birdseye, Matlab compiler is required.

For birdseed and larry_bird, the following are required:

* G++ 4.1.1 or higher (http://gcc.gnu.org)
* Affymetrix Power Tools (APT) 1.8.6 or higher, sources and libraries (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/developer/powertools/index.affx)

CONTENTS

This Birdsuite release includes 4 gzipped archives:

birdsuite_executables_<version>.tgz:  Scripts and executables that are already built.
MCRInstaller.75.glnxa64.bin.gz: Matlab 7.5 compiled runtime for 64-bit Linux
MCRInstaller.75.glnx86.bin.gz: Matlab 7.5 compiled runtime for 32-bit Linux
birdsuite_metadata_<version>.tgz:     Metadata required by Birdsuite.
birdsuite_inputs_<version>.tgz:  Test inputs for birdsuite (optional)
birdsuite_outputs_<version>.tgz: Output from test inputs  (optional)
birdsuite_sources_<version>.tgz:      Source code (optional)

INSTALLATION

1. Create a directory where all the Birdsuite executables will go.  We'll call this
   EXEDIR.

2. Unpack birdsuite_executables_<version>.tgz into EXEDIR.  

3. For 64-bit, copy (or symlink) the 64-bit version of apt-probeset-summarize from
   Affymetrix Power Tools into EXEDIR, with the name apt-probeset-summarize.64 .  

   For 32-bit, copy or symlink the 32-bit version of apt-probeset-summarize into EXEDIR,
   with the name apt-probeset-summarize .

   Note that you may do both of the above to run on both 32- and 64-bit systems.


4. Run the following commands:
   R CMD INSTALL -l EXEDIR EXEDIR/broadgap.utils_<version>.tar.gz 
   R CMD INSTALL -l EXEDIR EXEDIR/broadgap.cnputils_<version>.tar.gz 
   R CMD INSTALL -l EXEDIR EXEDIR/broadgap.canary_<version>.tar.gz

5. For 64-bit:
       Download MCRInstaller.75.glnxa64.bin.gz and decompress into temporary directory.
       Run the following command:
           MCRInstaller.75.glnxa64.bin -console
       When prompted for a directory into which to install MCR, reply with EXEDIR/MCR75_glnxa64
       MCRInstaller.75.glnxa64.bin may be deleted after installation is complete.

    For 32-bit:
       Download MCRInstaller.75.glnx86.bin.gz and decompress into temporary directory.
       Run the following command:
           MCRInstaller.75.glnx86.bin -console
       When prompted for a directory into which to install MCR, reply with EXEDIR/MCR75_glnx86
       MCRInstaller.75.glnx86.bin may be deleted after installation is complete.

   Note that you may do both of the above to run on both 32- and 64-bit systems.


7. Create a directory where all the Birdsuite metadata will go: METADATADIR

8. Unpack birdsuite_metadata_<version>.tgz into METADATADIR.

9. Copy the following files from the Affymetrix library bundle
    (genomewidesnp6_libraryfile.zip) into METADATADIR: GenomeWideSNP_6.Full.cdf,
    GenomeWideSNP_6.specialSNPs
    (For 5.0 chip, copy the analogous files.)

10. Edit EXEDIR/birdsuite.sh, and add the following arguments to the java command line:
    --exeDir=EXEDIR --metadataDir=METADATADIR

If you wish to use the birdsuite_qc.py script, which makes running mini-DM and gender
calling easier, follow these additional installation steps.

1. Copy or symlink GenomeWideSNP_6.cdf into METADATADIR.
    (For 5.0 chip, copy the analogous files)

2. Copy or symlink apt-geno-qc (from APT) into EXEDIR.

TESTING

1. Create a directory (TESTDIR) and unpack birdsuite_inputs_<version>.tgz there.  

2. cd to TESTDIR.

3. Run the following command: 
   EXEDIR/birdsuite.sh --basename=test --chipType=GenomeWideSNP_6 --outputDir=output --genderFile=test.gender --celFiles=test.cels --noLsf --apt_probeset_summarize.force

4. Create a directory (EXPECTEDDIR) and unpack birdsuite_outputs_<version>.tgz there.

5. Compare the files test.birdseed_calls, test.birdseed_confs, test.canary_calls,
   test.canary_confs, test.larry_bird_calls, test.larry_bird_confs in EXPECTEDDIR
   and TESTDIR/output.  They should be identical.
